- **Python** - Django, FastAPI, Flask, async frameworks
- **Java** - Spring Boot, design patterns, JVM optimization
- **Go** - Concurrency, performance, CLI tools
- **Rust** - Safety, performance, systems programming

### API Design & Development
- RESTful API design principles
- GraphQL implementation
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth, Session)
- Rate limiting & security
- API versioning & deprecation
- Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

### Database & Data
- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- Data modeling & normalization
- Query optimization
- Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Database replication & backup

### Advanced Architecture
- Microservices design
- Event-driven architecture
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Serverless architecture
- API gateways
- Backend monitoring & logging

## When to Use This Agent
